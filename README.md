The simplest way to run millions of jobs on hundreds of compute nodes
without overloading.

[Xeduler](http://xed.ch/project/xeduler) is a simple
job scheduler. It is designed to:

* have no exotic dependencies
* be very small
* not waste CPU resources
* be completely comprehensible
* be simple to configure
* leverage existing user expertise for interfacing
* be freely available
* publicly-licensed

This GitHub repository is a back up of my Xeduler system. Although you
should be able to understand this program by just reading the source
code -- _by design_ -- there is some more explanatory discussion on
the official [Xeduler project page](http://xed.ch/project/xeduler).
